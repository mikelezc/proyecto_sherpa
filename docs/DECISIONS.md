- Performance testing and monitoring

### Week 4: Background Tasks and Frontend (20%)
- Celery worker and beat setup
- Required background tasks implementation
- Django templates frontend
- Final testing and documentation

## Technical Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search
**Problem:** Complex implementation with Django ORM
**Solution:** Created custom SearchVector fields with GinIndex
**Learning:** PostgreSQL text search capabilities and Django integration

### Challenge 2: Celery Integration
**Problem:** Complex configuration with Django and Redis
**Solution:** Used django-celery-beat for database scheduling
**Learning:** Asynchronous task processing patterns

### Challenge 3: Frontend Template Architecture
**Problem:** Balancing simplicity with functionality requirements
**Solution:** Server-side rendering with minimal JavaScript
**Learning:** Django template system and Bootstrap integration

### Challenge 4: Docker Service Orchestration
**Problem:** Inter-service dependencies and startup order
**Solution:** Health checks and proper wait conditions
**Learning:** Docker Compose networking and service dependencies

## Trade-offs Made

### Django Templates vs React/Vue
**Decision:** Django Templates
**Trade-off:** Less interactive UI for simpler implementation
**Justification:** Requirements specify Django templates, faster development, server-side rendering benefits

### Simplified Authentication vs Complex Auth
**Decision:** Basic Django auth with simplified registration
**Trade-off:** Less enterprise features for easier demo
**Justification:** Adequate for demonstration, can be enhanced later

### In-memory Testing vs Full Test Suite
**Decision:** Manual testing with API documentation
**Trade-off:** Less automated testing for faster feature development
**Justification:** Time better spent on required features, manual testing sufficient for demo

### Console Email vs SMTP
**Decision:** Console backend for email
**Trade-off:** No real email sending for simplified setup
**Justification:** Easier demo setup, real SMTP trivial to configure

## What You Would Add With More Time

### Performance Enhancements
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database connection pooling optimization
- API response caching
- Query profiling and optimization tools

### Advanced Features
- Real-time notifications with WebSocket
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- File attachment support for tasks
- Advanced search with filters and facets

### Security Improvements
- Two-factor authentication
- Advanced rate limiting
- API versioning
- Security headers and CORS configuration

### DevOps and Monitoring
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Application monitoring and logging
- Performance metrics and alerting

### User Experience
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Advanced frontend with React/Vue
- Drag-and-drop task management

## Justification for Using Django Templates for the Frontend

### Technical Justification
1. **Requirement Compliance:** Specification explicitly requests Django templates
2. **Server-Side Rendering:** Better SEO and initial page load performance
3. **Simplicity:** Faster development without complex frontend build processes
4. **Integration:** Seamless integration with Django authentication and forms

### Architectural Benefits
1. **Single Technology Stack:** Reduces complexity and deployment requirements
2. **Built-in Security:** CSRF protection and XSS prevention out of the box
3. **Form Handling:** Django forms provide robust validation and rendering
4. **Template Inheritance:** Reusable components and consistent layout

### Development Efficiency
1. **Rapid Prototyping:** Quick iteration on UI changes
2. **Django Ecosystem:** Leverages existing Django knowledge and patterns
3. **No API Complexity:** Direct model-to-template rendering without API layer
4. **Debugging:** Easier debugging with Django debug toolbar

### Demonstration Value
1. **Full-Stack Showcase:** Demonstrates complete Django capabilities
2. **Production Ready:** Shows understanding of traditional web development
3. **Scalability Path:** Easy migration to API + SPA architecture later
4. **Maintainability:** Simpler codebase for long-term maintenance

The Django template approach perfectly balances the requirements for a functional demonstration while maintaining development efficiency and architectural soundness.
